# DHBO-CONVERTER
This is my new DHBO Converter which converts number between Decimal, Hexadecimal, Binary and Octal. This app doesn't provide direct answers (i.e one line answers) which is it's key feature. It instead provides answer with language, with each steps shown to the user. A detailed answer. It is inspired by the steps done in Class XI Book Of Computer.
