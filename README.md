# DHBO-CONVERTER
This is my new DHBO Converter which converts number between Decimal, Hexadecimal, Binary and Octal. This app doesn't provide direct answers (i.e one line answers) which is it's key feature. It instead provides answer with language, with each steps shown to the user. A detailed answer. It is inspired by the steps done in Class XI Book Of Computer.

More Details:
This program was made by using python. Inside python, only tkinter module was used. No other module except tkinter was used.
By language, I mean that this program can do your conversions with language which you can easily copy because it's taken straight from the book.


For those who don't have "WINRAR" or "7Z" to extract the ".rar" file, I've also compressed the same file in ".zip" format so it'll be easy for your Windows Explorer to 
easily extract the file without downloading any extra application.

I've recently updated this program. Took me about 3 days to update it. If I say more accurately, it took me non-stop 12 hours. 
What I added is amazing! It can now perform all of your fractional DHBO conversions in step-wise-step language format which you can easily copy.
Previously, it didn't support fractional calculations but now it does.

Note: The app I uploaded on releases has a few changes. It has been given a version name and the title has been changed from "DHBO CONVERTER BY Aaditya Kandel" to
"DHBO Converter" Those who will download the file directly from the repository will have the previous file and those who download from release will have the changed
file. That's all. No other changes are done.

This simply means that it can perform all of the Class X & XII questions easily and I mean it. ENJOY!!
