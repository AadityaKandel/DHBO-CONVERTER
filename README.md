# DHBO-CONVERTER
This is my new DHBO Converter which converts number between Decimal, Hexadecimal, Binary and Octal. This app doesn't provide direct answers (i.e one line answers) which is it's key feature. It instead provides answer with language, with each steps shown to the user. A detailed answer. It is inspired by the steps done in Class XI Book Of Computer.

More Details:
This program was made by using python. Inside python, only tkinter module was used. No other module except tkinter was used.
By language, I mean that this program can do your conversions with language which you can easily copy because it's taken straight from the book.
