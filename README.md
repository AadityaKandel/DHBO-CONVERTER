# DHBO-CONVERTER
This is my new DHBO Converter which converts number between Decimal, Hexadecimal, Binary and Octal. This app doesn't provide direct answers (i.e one line answers) which is it's key feature. It instead provides answer with language, with each steps shown to the user. A detailed answer. It is inspired by the steps done in Class XI Book Of Computer.

More Details:
This program was made by using python. Inside python, only tkinter module was used. No other module except tkinter was used.
Another library called "math" was also used but I really don't know where I actually used it. I recently updated the app but
I wasn't able to figure out where I actually used math library since I updated this program after 10 months. If you wan't to 
see the previous and latest version's source code, you can visit this repository:

It can perform all of the Class X & XII "Number System" questions easily. ENJOY!!
